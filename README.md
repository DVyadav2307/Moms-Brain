## Project Setup

- Download this repository from [GitHub](https://github.com/DVyadav2307/Moms-Brain.git) or use following command in git-cli.
  
  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/DVyadav2307/Moms-Brain.git
  ```
- Navigate to root directory of project and find the `gradlew` wrapper script.
  ```bash
  cd Moms-Brain
  ```
- Use the gradle wrapper scripts (`gradlew` or `gradlew.bat`) that are included in the repository to build the project. Gradle will automatically manage dependency and setup of the project:

  ```bash
  gradlew build
  ```

- Once project build completed you need to obtain security keys and tokens for the project. [Contact me](mailto:divyanshuy858@gmail.com) to obtain the keys and integration tutorials. You may like to join my discord channel:
